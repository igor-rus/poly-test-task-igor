An application takes two parameters: query string and json array of objects as string. Objects in array have flat structure, fields are not strictly defined (derive from query string). The application should return json array as string of objects matching the query string.

For simplicity we imply that only valid field names are passed to query string.

Sample query string:

* foo=someStringValue // in case of string value use contains logic
* foo=12
* foo>12
* foo<12
* foo>=12
* foo<=12
* foo>12 && bar<12 || baz=12

No parenthesis support needed for logical operations

NB! take into account logical operators precendence: true || false && false || false === true because actually it is the same as true || (false && false) || true, .i.e combination of ANDs is evaluated first.

How to run jumpstart project:

```bash
./gradlew fatJar
java -jar build/libs/poly-test-task-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar "name=Bob" '[{"name":"Bobby","age":25},{"name":"Rob","age":35}]'
```
